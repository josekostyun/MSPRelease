# MSP430FR2355 Embedded Firmware Project

This repository contains firmware for the **MSP430FR2355** microcontroller, developed using **Code Composer Studio (CCS)**.  
The project is structured into multiple source files for modular development, clarity, and maintainability.

---

## Features

- Configured system clock (8 MHz operation)
- UART communication with:
  - **GPS module** (NMEA sentence input)
  - **Bluetooth module (BM71 / RN4871)** for wireless data transmission
- GPS sentence buffering and parsing (e.g., `$GPGGA`)
- Structured firmware organization with reusable modules
- Designed for integration with a larger IoT data pipeline (e.g., mobile app + backend)
